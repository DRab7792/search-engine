THE ALLIES AFTER NASSAU IN DECEMBER 1960, THE U.S . FIRST
PROPOSED TO HELP NATO DEVELOP ITS OWN NUCLEAR STRIKE FORCE . BUT EUROPE
MADE NO ATTEMPT TO DEVISE A PLAN . LAST WEEK, AS THEY STUDIED THE
NASSAU ACCORD BETWEEN PRESIDENT KENNEDY AND PRIME MINISTER MACMILLAN,
EUROPEANS SAW EMERGING THE FIRST OUTLINES OF THE NUCLEAR NATO THAT THE
U.S . WANTS AND WILL SUPPORT . IT ALL SPRANG FROM THE ANGLO-U.S .
CRISIS OVER CANCELLATION OF THE BUG-RIDDEN SKYBOLT MISSILE, AND THE
U.S . OFFER TO SUPPLY BRITAIN AND FRANCE WITH THE PROVED POLARIS (TIME,
DEC . 28) . THE ONE ALLIED LEADER WHO UNRESERVEDLY WELCOMED THE POLARIS
OFFER WAS HAROLD MACMILLAN, WHO BY THUS KEEPING A SEPARATE NUCLEAR
DETERRENT FOR BRITAIN HAD SAVED HIS OWN NECK . BACK FROM NASSAU, THE
PRIME MINISTER BEAMED THAT BRITAIN NOW HAD A WEAPON THAT " WILL LAST A
GENERATION . THE TERMS ARE VERY GOOD . " MANY OTHER BRITONS WERE NOT SO
SURE . THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT WILL SHOULDER NONE OF THE $800 MILLION
DEVELOPMENT COST OF POLARIS, IT HAS ALREADY POURED $28 MILLION INTO
SKYBOLT AND WILL HAVE TO SPEND PERHAPS $1 BILLION MORE FOR A FLEET OF
MISSILE-PACKING SUBMARINES . AT BEST, THE BRITISH WILL NOT BE ABLE TO
DESIGN, BUILD AND PROVE ITS NUCLEAR FLEET BEFORE 1970, THREE YEARS
AFTER BRITAIN'S BOMBER FORCE HAS PRESUMABLY BECOME OBSOLETE . THEN WHAT
? TORY BACKBENCHERS ARE LOUDLY SKEPTICAL OF WHAT THEY CALL " THE
SMALL TYPE " IN THE NASSAU PACT, WHICH STIPULATES THAT BRITAIN'S
POLARIS SUBMARINE FLEET, EXCEPT WHEN " SUPREME NATIONAL INTERESTS "
INTERVENE, MUST BE COMMITTED TO A TRULY MULTILATERAL NATO FORCE . DOES
THAT MEAN THAT BRITAIN WILL EVENTUALLY HAVE NO STRIKE FORCE OF ITS OWN
? WHO WILL DECIDE WHEN OR WHETHER NATIONAL INTERESTS JUSTIFY
WITHDRAWAL OF SUBMARINES FROM NATO, PARTICULARLY IF THOSE NATIONAL
INTERESTS CONFLICT WITH U.S . POLICY ? THE BIGGEST QUESTION OF ALL IS
WHETHER FRANCE'S INCLUSION IN THE OFFER WAS A DELIBERATE PLOY BY JACK
KENNEDY TO END OR AT LEAST DOWNGRADE BRITAIN'S PRIZED " SPECIAL
RELATIONSHIP " WITH THE U.S . THE CARTOONISTS WENT EVEN FARTHER . THEY
NOT ONLY SHOWED SUPERMAC JUMPING TO SUPERJACK'S COMMANDS, BUT DE GAULLE
AND ADENAUER AS WELL . AS EDITH SAID . THE FRENCH, WHO GOT NO HELP FROM
THE U.S . IN DEVELOPING THEIR FORCE DE FRAPPE, WERE QUICK TO CROW THAT
BRITAIN'S VAUNTED TIES WITH THE U.S . HAD BROUGHT IT NOTHING BUT
HUMILIATION . BY CONTRAST, BRAGGED FRENCH OFFICIALS, THE SKYBOLT FIASCO
ONLY VINDICATED FRANCE'S DECISION TO DEVELOP ITS OWN BOMBS AND DELIVERY
SYSTEMS . THUS, THOUGH CHARLES DE GAULLE PROMISED TO " REFLECT " ON THE
POLARIS OFFER, THERE WAS LITTLE LIKELIHOOD THAT HE WOULD ACCEPT ANY
OFFER THAT WOULD SUBJECT A FRENCH FORCE TO ALLIED CONTROL . IT IS DE
GAULLE'S UNSWERVING CONVICTION THAT IF THE RUSSIANS WERE ACTUALLY TO
INVADE WESTERN EUROPE, NO NATION THAT WAS NOT DIRECTLY ATTACKED MEANING
THE U.S . WOULD INVITE NUCLEAR DEVASTATION BY HELPING ITS ALLIES . THUS
UNLIKE BRITAIN'S BOMBER FORCE, WHICH ALL ALONG HAS BEEN PLEDGED TO "
THE WESTERN STRATEGIC DETERRENT, " FRANCE'S FORCE DE FRAPPE WILL BE
RESPONSIBLE ONLY FOR FRANCE'S DEFENSE . AT THE SAME TIME, DE GAULLE HAS
LONG ARGUED THAT THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE COULD BE RUN MOST EFFICIENTLY BY
A TRIUMVIRATE THAT WOULD INCLUDE FRANCE AS AN EQUAL OF THE U.S . AND
BRITAIN . THIS IS ONE OF HIS MAJOR, IF UNSPOKEN, CONDITIONS FOR BRITISH
MEMBERSHIP IN THE COMMON MARKET ; AND DE GAULLE SUGGESTED POINTEDLY TO
MACMILLAN THAT IT WOULD HELP IF BRITAIN WERE TO SHARE ITS ADVANCED
MISSILE TECHNOLOGY WITH FRANCE . WHEN MACMILLAN REPLIED NONCOMMITTALLY
THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO DISCUSS THIS WITH KENNEDY, DE GAULLE TOLD HIS
GUEST WITH HAUTEUR THAT FRANCE IN THAT CASE COULD DO NOTHING TO EASE
BRITAIN'S ENTRY INTO EUROPE . GO-IT-ALONE GRANDEUR . KONRAD ADENAUER,
ON THE OTHER HAND, IS FEARFUL THAT DE GAULLE WILL SNAP UP THE POLARIS
OFFER AND IN THIS WAY ACHIEVE HIS GOAL OF A THREE-NATION NATO
DIRECTORATE . THOUGH HIS GOVERNMENT VOWED IN 1954 NOT TO MANUFACTURE
NUCLEAR WEAPONS, ADENAUER HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY APPREHENSIVE THAT
WITHOUT THEM, AND WITH NO SAY IN THEIR USE, WEST GERMANY WILL BE
RELEGATED TO SECOND-CLASS CITIZENSHIP IN THE ALLIANCE . LAST WEEK AN
OFFICIAL BULLETIN EVEN REVIVED THE OLD, BITTER CRY THAT U.S . PLEAS FOR
GREATER RELIANCE ON CONVENTIONAL FORCES ARE AIMED AT RAISING GERMAN "
CANNON FODDER " FOR U.S . " ATOMIC KNIGHTS . " A FROSTY LETTER FROM THE
CHANCELLOR TO PRESIDENT KENNEDY SUGGESTED THAT GERMANY, WHICH ALREADY
SUPPLIES ALMOST 50 PER CENT OF NATO GROUND STRENGTH, DOES NOT INTEND TO
RAISE ANY MORE DIVISIONS FOR CONVENTIONAL WARFARE . YET U.S . STRATEGIC
PLANNERS REASON THAT THE ONLY CREDIBLE DETERRENT TO SOVIET ATTACK IS A
STRONG ARMY ON THE GROUND, BACKED BY THE VAST U.S . NUCLEAR ARSENAL .
FACT IS, THE BRITISH AND FRENCH NUCLEAR WEAPONS COULD NEVER BE USED
INDEPENDENTLY OF THE U.S . AGAINST RUSSIA WITHOUT INVITING DEVASTATING
SOVIET RETALIATION . AFTER ALL THEIR EFFORTS, THE BRITISH AND FRENCH
WILL HAVE MANAGED TO CREATE A NUCLEAR CAPACITY THAT REPRESENTS ONLY 4
PER CENT OF U.S . NUCLEAR POWER . " IT IS JUST A DAMNED NUISANCE, "
SAID A STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL LAST WEEK . " IT MEANS NOTHING
MILITARILY EXCEPT THAT WE WILL BE EXPECTED TO BAIL OUT THE FIRST
COUNTRY THAT THROWS THE FIRST PEA AT THE RUSSIANS OR ANYONE ELSE . "
CHARLES DE GAULLE COULD HARDLY BE EXPECTED TO AGREE, AT LEAST UNTIL HIS
FORCE DE FRAPPE BECOMES OBSOLETE . FOR BRITAIN AND GERMANY, THE
MULTILATERAL DETERRENT MAKES IMMEDIATE SENSE . EVENTUALLY, FRANCE, TOO,
MAY WELL FIND A NATO-CONTROLLED POLARIS FLEET, OR ITS POSSIBLE
SUCCESSOR, A EUROPEAN MINUTEMAN ARSENAL, THE ONLY ANSWER TO THE
SPIRALING COST AND DIMINISHING VALUE OF GO-IT-ALONE GRANDEUR .

RUSSIA WHO'S IN CHARGE HERE ? IT WAS IN 1954 THAT NIKITA
KHRUSHCHEV LAUNCHED HIS GRANDIOSE " VIRGIN LANDS " GAMBLE . PART OF THE
PLAN WAS TO PLOW UP 32 MILLION ACRES OF MARGINAL LAND IN KAZAKHSTAN,
AND SETTLE IT WITH COMMUNIST " PIONEERS, " WHO WERE TO PLANT AND
PRODUCE HUGE QUANTITIES OF DESPERATELY NEEDED GRAIN WITHIN TWO YEARS .
NIKITA'S SCHEME FLOPPED . THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH RAINFALL, AND THE
PIONEERS DID NOT TAKE TO TRACTOR LIFE ON THE BLEAK FRONTIER . EXCEPT
FOR 1958, EACH HARVEST HAS BEEN LOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS YEAR'S . WORST
YEAR OF ALL WAS 1962, WHEN THE VIRGIN LANDS DELIVERED ONLY HALF THEIR
QUOTAS . NATURALLY, KHRUSHCHEV TAKES NONE OF THE BLAME FOR THE FIASCO .
THREE YEARS AGO HE FOUND A SCAPEGOAT IN KAZAKHSTAN PARTY BOSS NIKOLAI
BELYAEV, FIRED HIM FOR HIS " ERRORS . " LAST WEEK BELYAEV'S SUCCESSOR,
DINMUKHAMED KUNAEV, WAS SIMILARLY BOUNCED FOR " LAPSES " IN HIS WORK .
FOR GOOD MEASURE, MOSCOW ALSO PURGED THE FORMER PREMIER OF THE
TERRITORY FROM THE LOCAL PARTY'S CENTRAL COMMITTEE . IT WAS PERHAPS NO
COINCIDENCE THAT NIKOLAI IGNATOV, 61, A ONETIME KHRUSHCHEV CRONY, LAST
WEEK ABRUPTLY LEFT HIS POST AS A SOVIET DEPUTY PREMIER AFTER ONLY NINE
MONTHS ON THE JOB . FARM EXPERT IGNATOV HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO BE BOSS
OF A SPECIAL COMMITTEE TO BOOST FOOD PRODUCTION .

BERLIN ONE LAST RUN HANS WEIDNER HAD BEEN HOPING FOR MONTHS TO
ESCAPE DRAB EAST GERMANY AND MAKE HIS WAY TO THE WEST . THE ODDS WERE
AGAINST HIM, FOR WEIDNER, 40, WAS A CRIPPLE ON CRUTCHES WHO LIVED IN
THE VILLAGE OF NEUGERSDORF, 115 MILES SOUTHEAST OF THE FRONTIER OF
FREEDOM BUT HANS WEIDNER DID HAVE ONE MAJOR ASSET, THE BUS THAT
HE OPERATED FOR THE LOCAL COMMUNIST REGIME . IT WAS AN UGLY THING, AND
ANCIENT . ITS CHASSIS CREAKED, AND THE ENGINE COUGHED ; A
CREAM-COLORED COAT OF PAINT COULD NOT DISGUISE THE WELTS AND BRUISES OF
TWO DECADES OF CHUGGING SERVICE . IN FACT, THE BUS WAS READY FOR THE
JUNK PILE WHEN WEIDNER DECIDED TO PRESS IT INTO SERVICE FOR ONE LAST
RUN . SHARP BLADES . THE HAZARDS WOULD BE GREAT ON THE JOURNEY TO THE
BORDER ; SO WEIDNER SIGNED UP A FELLOW VILLAGER, JURGEN WAGNER, 22, TO
TAKE THE WHEEL . EIGHT DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS, THE PAIR BEGAN THE
FEVERISH PREPARATIONS IN WEIDNER'S GARAGE . FIRST WEIDNER AND WAGNER
ATTACHED A HEAVY SNOWPLOW TO THE FRONT OF THE BUS, NOT TO PLOW SNOW,
BUT TO SCOOP AWAY THE HEAVY OBSTACLES THEY KNEW AWAITED THEM AT
ROADBLOCKS AHEAD . TO ALL SIX LUGS ON EACH FRONT WHEEL THEY BOLTED
SHARP BLADES OF THE TOUGHEST STEEL, AFFIXED SO THAT THE WHIRLING EDGES
WOULD CHOP BARBED WIRE TO BITS . THEN THEY WEDGED ONE-QUARTER-INCH
SECTIONS OF STEEL PLATE INSIDE THE BUS TO STOP BULLETS . AT LAST ALL
WAS READY . ON CHRISTMAS EVE, WEIDNER AND WAGNER PILED THEIR WIVES AND
FOUR CHILDREN ABOARD, NOT FORGETTING THREE TONS OF HOUSEHOLD BELONGINGS
. FOR ADDED PROTECTION THE PLOTTERS SHOVELED A TON OF COAL AND POTATOES
INTO THE BACK OF THE BUS . THEN THEY CHUGGED OFF NORTH TOWARD BERLIN
ALONG BACK ROADS TO ESCAPE COMMUNIST PATROLS . JUST BEFORE THEY REACHED
THE WALL, THEY PLANNED TO SWING WEST IN ORDER TO ENTER THE EAST-WEST
AUTOBAHN LEADING TO THE U.S . SECTOR OF THE CITY . EN ROUTE, THE
RADIATOR FROZE IN THE SUBZERO WEATHER . THAT FIXED, THEY WERE ONLY A
FEW MILES FARTHER WHEN A TIRE BLEW OUT . THE KIDS WERE CRYING AND THE
WIVES SHIVERING WITH COLD AND PANIC WHEN, AT LAST, THEY ARRIVED AT
DREWITZ, THE MOST HEAVILY GUARDED CHECKPOINT ON THE ENTIRE AUTOBAHN TO
BERLIN . IT WAS NO TIME TO STOP AND RECONSIDER . FLYING POTATOES . "
WAH-AH, WAH-AH, " SHRIEKED THE POLICE-TYPE KLAXONS THAT WEIDNER HAD
THOUGHTFULLY INSTALLED IN ADVANCE . THE COMMUNIST GUARDS OBEDIENTLY
RAISED THE FIRST OF THREE BARRIERS . BUT WHAT WAS A BUS DOING ON
EMERGENCY DUTY ? SUDDENLY THE SHOOTING BEGAN TOO LATE . WAGNER, AT 40
M.P.H., WAS ALREADY CRASHING THROUGH THE SECOND BARRIER 100 YARDS
AHEAD, THEN THE THIRD, ONLY 20 YARDS AWAY . ITS WINDSHIELD SMASHED, ITS
PASSENGERS SHAKEN, ITS CARGO OF COAL AND POTATOES IN EVERY CORNER OF
THE CAB, THE OLD BUS FINALLY LURCHED TO A STOP A FEW MILES DOWN THE
ROAD WHERE THE COMMUNISTS NO LONGER MATTERED AT THE U.S . CHECKPOINT, A
FOOT OR TWO INSIDE WEST BERLIN .

THE ROAD TO JAIL IS PAVED WITH NONOBJECTIVE ART SINCE THE
KREMLIN'S SHARPEST BARBS THESE DAYS ARE AIMED AT MODERN ART AND "
WESTERN ESPIONAGE, " IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THE KGB'S COPS
WOULD TURN UP A VICTIM WHOSE WRONGDOINGS COMBINED BOTH EVILS . HE
TURNED OUT TO BE A LENINGRAD PHYSICS TEACHER WHOSE TASTE FOR ABSTRACT
PAINTING ALLEGEDLY LED HIM TO JOIN THE U.S . SPY SERVICE . POLICE SAID
THEY FIRST SPOTTED THE TEACHER, ONE RUDOLF FRIEDMAN, AS HE MUTTERED
UNCOMPLIMENTARY REMARKS ABOUT SOCIALIST REALISM WHILE STROLLING THROUGH
LENINGRAD'S RUSSIAN MUSEUM . A WELL-DRESSED U.S . TOURIST APPROACHED
HIM, ENTHUSIASTICALLY SHARED HIS SENTIMENTS, AND PROMISED TO SEND
FRIEDMAN REPRODUCTIONS OF AVANT-GARDE PAINTINGS FROM AMERICA . THE
PICTURE FRIEDMAN LIKED BEST, SAID THE COPS INDIGNANTLY, WAS A " CHAOS
OF BLACK, RED AND BLUE SPLOTCHES CAPTIONED I NEED YOU TONIGHT . " SOON,
THEY SAID, THE TEACHER WAS GETTING MESSAGES FROM THE U.S . WRITTEN IN
INVISIBLE INK . JUST AS FRIEDMAN PREPARED TO DELIVER INFORMATION " VERY
REMOTE FROM THEORETICAL ARGUMENTS ABOUT ABSTRACT ART, " POLICEMOVED IN
AND HUSTLED HIM OFF TO JAIL .

THE CONGO ROUND 3 ? THE SOUND OF
CHRISTMAS IN KATANGA PROVINCE WAS THE THUNK OF MORTAR SHELLS AND THE
RATTLE OF MACHINE GUNS . AFTER AN UNEASY TWELVE-MONTH TRUCE BETWEEN U.N
. FORCES AND THE TROOPS OF KATANGA'S SECESSIONIST MOISE TSHOMBE, A FEW
MINOR INCIDENTS GOT OUT OF HAND, AND FOR THE THIRD TIME SINCE SEPTEMBER
1961 THE PROVINCE WAS IN TURMOIL . BLUE-HELMETED U.N . SOLDIERS SWARMED
THROUGH ELISABETHVILLE, SEIZED ROADBLOCKS ON THE HIGHWAYS . SWEDISH U.N
. SAAB JETS SWOOPED LOW OVER KATANGA'S AIRFIELD AT KOLWEZI, DESTROYING
FOUR PLANES ON THE GROUND AND SETTING OIL TANKS ABLAZE . IN THE FIRST
SKIRMISHES, SEVEN U.N . SOLDIERS WERE DEAD . THE FIGHTING BEGAN WITH
WHAT ELISABETHVILLE RESIDENTS CALL " L'AFFAIRE SIMBA " A REFERENCE TO
SIMBA BEER, THE LOCAL BREW THAT BOTH SIDES GUZZLED ON AND OFF DUTY . AS
THE U.N . TOLD IT, BOOZED-UP KATANGESE GENDARMES SUDDENLY OPENED FIRE
ON A DETACHMENT OF ETHIOPIAN U.N . TROOPS IN SUBURBAN LUBUMBASHI . AS
TSHOMBE DESCRIBED MATTERS, A FEW TIPSY ETHIOPIANS STARTED THE SHOOTING
BY SCRAMBLING ATOP A 200-FT . SLAG HEAP OUTSIDE THE BIG UNION MINIERE
PLANT AND TAKING POTSHOTS AT THE KATANGESE . FIREWORKS NEXT . IN ANY
CASE, KATANGESE SOLDIERS AT A GOLF COURSE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF
ELISABETHVILLE TOOK THE OCCASION TO SHOOT DOWN AN UNARMED U.N .
HELICOPTER MOVING OVERHEAD . THEY STONED THE SIX SURVIVING CREWMEN,
PUMMELED THEM WITH RIFLE BUTTS ; A 23-YEAR-OLD SIKH LIEUTENANT, WHO
LAY HELPLESS WITH A MACHINE GUN SLUG IN THE ABDOMEN, DIED UNATTENDED IN
THREE HOURS . INDIAN BRIGADIER REGINALD NORONHA, COMMANDER OF U.N .
TROOPS IN KATANGA'S CAPITAL, WAS FURIOUS THIS IS THE LAST TIME, HE SAID
. " NEXT TIME THERE ARE GOING TO BE FIREWORKS . " NORONHA DID NOT HAVE
LONG TO WAIT . THREE DAYS LATER AN ETHIOPIAN GUARD FIRED A WARNING SHOT
AT A KATANGESE SOLDIER WHO WAS APPROACHING HIS POST . UNHURT, THE
KATANGESE ROLLED DOWN A HILL IN SEARCH OF COVER, BUT HIS COMRADES
THOUGHT HE HAD BEEN HIT AND OPENED FIRE . SOON U.N . POSITIONS AROUND
THE CITY WERE UNDER ATTACK . TSHOMBE " AGREED " TO A CEASE-FIRE, BUT
HIS 20,000 MEN KEPT RIGHT ON FIGHTING . " THEY ARE MAD, " SAID A RED
CROSS OFFICIAL WHO SAW THEM RAMPAGING THROUGH A TOWNSHIP, FIRING AT
ANYTHING THAT MOVED . " THEY ARE KILLING THEIR OWN MEN . " THE U.N .
CLAIMED TSHOMBE HAD LOST CONTROL OF HIS MEN WHICH GAVE IT AN EXCUSE TO
STRIKE BACK . FROM MANHATTAN U.N . HEADQUARTERS, ORDERS WERE FLASHED TO
THE 12,000-MAN U.N . FORCE IN KATANGA : " TAKE ALL NECESSARY ACTION IN
SELF-DEFENSE AND TO RESTORE ORDER . " SPEARHEADED BY 5,700 TOUGH,
BITTER GURKHAS, THE U.N . FORCE METHODICALLY SWEPT DISORGANIZED
KATANGESE TROOPS FROM THEIR GUARDPOSTS ON THE ROAD TO NORTHERN RHODESIA
. POWER LINES FELL IN THE FRAY, LEAVING SHABBY LITTLE ELISABETHVILLE
(POP . 180,000) WITHOUT LIGHT, WATER OR PHONES .
SPEARS & ARROWS . NORONHA DEMANDED ONCE MORE
THAT TSHOMBE CALL A CEASEFIRE, WARNED THAT UNLESS HE COMPLIED IN 30
MINUTES, " A GENERAL WAR WILL BEGIN . " TSHOMBE REJECTED THE ULTIMATUM,
AND THE U.N . WENT OVER TO AN ALL-OUT AIR AND GROUND OFFENSIVE . THE
INDIAN BRIGADE STORMED AND CAPTURED THE HEADQUARTERS OF KATANGA'S
GENDARMERIE AT KARAVIA, A MILE FROM ELISABETHVILLE, WITH LITTLE
RESISTANCE . ANOTHER COLUMN OF TROOPS ADVANCED NORTHWEST TOWARD
JADOTVILLE, IN THE HEART OF THE COPPER BELT THAT GIVES TSHOMBE $40
MILLION A YEAR IN REVENUES . U.N . FORCES ANNOUNCED THAT THEY HAD TAKEN
OVER ELISABETHVILLE'S POST OFFICE, RADIO STATION AND RAILWAY DEPOT AND
HAD OCCUPIED TSHOMBE'S PALACE . AT THE HEIGHT OF THE SHOOTING, TSHOMBE
VANISHED INTO HIDING, BUT HE WAS NOT CALLING IT QUITS . " EVERYWHERE,
THE U.N . AND ITS TROOPS WILL BE FOUGHT WITH TRAPS, WITH POISONED
ARROWS AND SPEARS, " HE SAID IN AN ANGRY STATEMENT THROUGH ONE OF HIS
AIDES . " WE WILL RESIST BY ALL MEANS, INCLUDING THE TOTAL DESTRUCTION
OF ALL OUR ECONOMIC POTENTIAL . " WAS THIS THE FINAL SHOWDOWN IN THE
U.N.'S 2F-YEAR ATTEMPT TO END KATANGA'S SECESSION FROM THE CONGO ?
U.N . SPOKESMEN INSISTED THAT IT WAS NOT, BUT SECRETARY-GENERAL U THANT
SAYS HE IS CONVINCED THAT UNLESS TSHOMBE IS SUBDUED SOON, PREMIER
CYRILLE ADOULA'S CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IN LEOPOLDVILLE WILL COLLAPSE . THE
U.S . AGREES, AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT RECENTLY HAS BEEN TALKING UP THE
IMMINENT DANGER OF A LEFTIST, SOVIET-BACKED TAKEOVER IN LEOPOLDVILLE .
BUT THE BRITISH, WHO SEE KATANGA AS A STABLE BUFFER FOR THE RHODESIAS,
WARNED AGAINST THE " FUTILITY OF TRYING TO IMPOSE A POLITICAL
SETTLEMENT BY FORCE . " THE FRENCH, WHO, LIKE THE BRITISH, HAVE HEAVY
INVESTMENTS IN THE UNION MINIERE, WANT HANDS OFF, AND IN BRUSSELS, 200

TUNISIA DOUBLE JEOPARDY AS A DEDICATED TUNISIAN NATIONALIST,
PRESIDENT HABIB BOURGUIBA, 59, IS A POPULAR HERO TO MOST OF THE
MILLIONS WHO HAVE FOLLOWED HIM SINCE INDEPENDENCE WAS WON IN 1956 . BUT
BOURGUIBA ALSO HAS HIS DEADLY ENEMIES . LAST WEEK A DETERMINED GROUP OF
THE LATTER ALMOST SUCCEEDED IN ASSASSINATING TUNISIA'S STOCKY
CHIEFTAIN . THE PLOTTERS ACTUALLY MADE TWO ATTEMPTS ON BOURGUIBA'S LIFE
. THE FIRST TRY FAILED ON DEC . 15 BECAUSE BOURGUIBA DID NOT SPEND THE
NIGHT AT HIS PRESIDENTIAL PALACE AT CARTHAGE, NEAR TUNIS . THE PLOTTERS
NEXT LAID THEIR PLANS FOR MIDNIGHT, DEC . 21, AND EVEN BOURGUIBA'S
PERSONAL BODYGUARD AGREED TO LEAD THE KILLERS TO THE PRESIDENT'S
BEDSIDE . NO REPLACEMENT . A FEW HOURS BEFORE MIDNIGHT, A TUNISIAN ARMY
NON-COM BURST IN UPON A DEFENSE MINISTRY OFFICIAL AND BLURTED THE
DETAILS OF THE PLOT . THAT NIGHT, AND ON FOLLOWING DAYS, MORE THAN A
HUNDRED PLOTTERS WERE JAILED . THEY PROVED TO BE A HANDFUL OF DISSIDENT
ARMY OFFICERS AND SOME DISGRUNTLED LANDOWNERS . BUT THE HARD CORE
SEEMED TO BE SUPPORTERS OF BOURGUIBA'S OLD FOE, THE LATE SALAH BEN
YOUSSEF, WHO LOST A BITTER STRUGGLE FOR CONTROL OF NEO-DESTOUR,
TUNISIA'S ONLY POLITICAL PARTY, AND WENT INTO EXILE IN 1955 . WHEN BEN
YOUSSEF WAS MURDERED IN WEST GERMANY IN 1961 HIS FOLLOWERS BACK HOME
BLAMED BOURGUIBA AGENTS, SWORE VENGEANCE ON TUNISIA'S BOSS HIMSELF .
THE PLOTTERS' ONLY PLAN, APPARENTLY, WAS TO SLAY THE PRESIDENT . SAID
BOURGUIBA : " AFTER MY DEATH THE COUNTRY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A STATE OF
TOTAL ANARCHY . THE PLOTTERS THOUGHT ONLY OF ELIMINATING ME, NOT
REPLACING ME . " CROWDS GATHERED TO HEAR OFFICIAL SPEECHES OF
INDIGNATION AT THE ATTEMPT ON BOURGUIBA'S LIFE . THERE SEEMED LITTLE
DOUBT THAT HE STILL HELD THE NATION'S BASIC LOYALTY, BUT EVEN HIS
CLOSEST FRIENDS WERE CONCERNED AT THE RECENT SIGNS OF UNREST CAUSED BY
THREE SUCCESSIVE YEARS OF DROUGHT AND AN UNEMPLOYMENT LEVEL OF 400,000
OUT OF A POPULATIONS OF 4,000,000 . BOURGUIBA IS ALSO AWARE OF THE
MUTTERING OF MANY ABOUT THE THREE EXPENSIVE NEW PALACES HE HAS RECENTLY
BUILT . THESE " BELONG TO THE STATE, " HE RETORTED IN HIS " I AM ALIVE
/ SPEECH . HE ADDED WITH SOME BITTERNESS : " THERE IS A TENDENCY TO
FORGET THAT I SPENT 30 YEARS IN FRENCH JAILS FOR MY COUNTRY . " KNOCKED
HEADS . IN HIS EFFORTS TO RESHAPE TUNISIA AS A MODERN NATION, BOURGUIBA
HAS HAD TO KNOCK HEADS TOGETHER . INEVITABLY, SOME ARMY OFFICERS RESENT
THE BACKSEAT ROLE HE GIVES THE MILITARY . AND MOSLEM RELIGIOUS LEADERS
ARE ANGERED BY HIS ATTEMPT TO ABOLISH THE DAY-LONG FASTS OF THE MONTH
OF RAMADAN, AND BY HIS EMANCIPATION OF WOMEN . A U.S .INVESTIGATING
COMMITTEE IN 1961 AGREED THAT BOURGUIBA WAS MAKING THE RIGHT MOVES TO
SOLVE TUNIS'S ECONOMIC ILLS, BUT WARNED THAT HE MIGHT BE ASKING TOO
GREAT SACRIFICES OF HIS PEOPLE . AFTER LAST WEEK'S BRUSH WITH DEATH,
BOURGUIBA MAY GO FORWARD A BIT MORE SLOWLY, AND CAN UNDOUBTEDLY DRAW
SOME SUPPORT FROM THE FACT THAT LAST MONTH THE U.S . FINALLY AGREED TO
GRANT TUNISIA $180 MILLION IN ECONOMIC AID OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS .

KASHMIR TALKING AT LAST THE BRITISH RAJ, WHICH ONCE
CONTROLLED INDIA'S NORTHWEST FRONTIER PROVINCE OF KASHMIR, EXACTED A
TOKEN ANNUAL TRIBUTE OF TWO KASHMIRI SHAWLS AND THREE HANDKERCHIEFS
FROM THE MAHARAJAH . NEVER SINCE HAS THE PRICE OF PEACE BEEN AS SMALL .
IN THE YEARS AFTER INDEPENDENCE IN 1947 SPLIT THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
INTO THE SOVEREIGN STATES OF INDIA AND PAKISTAN, THE TWO NATIONS HAVE
PAID WITH STRIFE AND BLOODSHED TO ESTABLISH THEIR CONFLICTING CLAIMS
OVER THE DISPUTED REGION . LAST WEEK, AFTER 15 YEARS OF BITTER
WRANGLING, INDIAN AND PAKISTANI DELEGATES FINALLY MET IN THE PAKISTAN
CAPITAL OF RAWALPINDI TO SEEK A SOLUTION TO THE KASHMIR PROBLEM . THE
DISPUTED LAND IS THE SIZE OF MINNESOTA, LAKES AND ALL . IT FALLS FROM
THE WINDWHIPPED MOUNTAINS OF GILGIT AND LADAKH IN THE NORTH TO THE
IDYLLIC VALE OF KASHMIR . IN THE HIMALAYAS, PRIMITIVE MOUNTAIN
TRIBESMEN KEEP HERDS OF GRACEFUL, SURE-FOOTED KASHMIR GOATS, WHOSE SOFT
FLEECE BECOMES THE CASHMERE OF FIFTH AVENUE AND REGENT STREET ; THE
COOL LAKES NEAR KASHMIR'S CAPITAL CITY OF SRINAGAR ARE DOTTED WITH THE
ELEGANT HOUSEBOATS OF WEALTHY INDIANS . VOW FORGOTTEN . AT THE TIME OF
PARTITION, KASHMIR, LIKE ALL OF INDIA'S 562 PRINCELY STATES, WAS GIVEN
THE CHOICE OF JOINING EITHER PAKISTAN OR INDIA . THE FACT THAT 77 PER
CENT OF KASHMIR'S 4,200,000 PEOPLE WERE MOSLEM POINTED TO CONTROL BY
MOSLEM PAKISTAN . BUT THOUGH HE HAD SIGNED PRELIMINARY TRADE AND
ADMINISTRATIVE AGREEMENTS WITH PAKISTAN, KASHMIR'S HINDU MAHARAJAH
BEGAN TO HEDGE . ANGERED BY HIS FAILURE TO ACCEDE TO PAKISTAN, HORDES
OF PAKISTANI " VOLUNTEERS " SWEPT INTO KASHMIR TO ESTABLISH PAKISTAN'S
CLAIM TO THE LAND . IN TERROR, THE HINDU RULER OPTED TO JOIN INDIA,
APPEALED FOR IMMEDIATE MILITARY AID . INDIA WAS HAPPY TO RESPOND,
AIRLIFTED TROOPS INTO KASHMIR TO FORTIFY ITS OWN CLAIM . THUS BEGAN A
FULL-SCALE WAR IN KASHMIR . INDIA WENT TO THE UNITED NATIONS FOR RELIEF
. IN 1949 THE U.N . DEMARCATED A CEASE-FIRE LINE THAT GAVE INDIA THE
RICHEST TWO-THIRDS OF KASHMIR, INCLUDING MOST OF LADAKH, THE VALE, AND
THE PREDOMINANTLY HINDU AREA OF JAMMU . BUT INDIA'S PRIME MINISTER
JAWAHARLAL NEHRU HAD PLEDGED THAT " THE FATE OF KASHMIR MUST ULTIMATELY
BE DECIDED BY ITS PEOPLE . " DECLARED NEHRU : " WE ARE PREPARED, WHEN
PEACE, LAW AND ORDER HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED, TO HAVE A REFERENDUM UNDER
SOME INTERNATIONAL AUSPICES LIKE THE U.N . " NEHRU SOON FORGOT THAT
VOW, FOR IT BECAME OBVIOUS THAT KASHMIR WOULD VOTE EITHER FOR
INDEPENDENCE OR ACCESSION TO PAKISTAN . INDIAN KASHMIR'S MOSLEM RULER,
SHEIK MOHAMMED ABDULLAH, AN OLD FRIEND OF NEHRU'S AND A FIERY KASHMIRI
NATIONALIST, CONFUSED THINGS BY STARTING TO PROMOTE A LOCAL
INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT . INDIA CLAPPED SHEIK ABDULLAH INTO JAIL IN 1953
AND INTRODUCED A SERIES OF REPRESSIVE MEASURES TO HALT OTHER
NATIONALIST OR PROPAKISTAN MOVEMENTS . EXCEPT FOR THREE MONTHS IN 1958,
SHEIK ABDULLAH HAS LANGUISHED IN PRISON EVER SINCE, WAS LAST WEEK ON
TRIAL ON CHARGES OF CONSPIRACY TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT . NUDGE FROM
THE NORTH . THE IMPRISONMENT OF SHEIK ABDULLAH SYMBOLIZED ALL OF
PAKISTAN'S DEEP DISTRUST OF NEHRU . DESPITE HIS OUTWARD DEVOTION TO THE
U.N., NO AMOUNT OF U.N . PRESSURE COULD BRING NEHRU TO THE BARGAINING
TABLE WITH PAKISTAN OVER KASHMIR . BUT WHEN RED CHINA THRUST DEEP INTO
INDIA'S HIMALAYAN BORDERLAND LAST OCTOBER, NEHRU RELUCTANTLY YIELDED TO
THE INSISTENT ENVOYS OF THE U.S . AND BRITAIN WHO SUGGESTED THAT UNLESS
INDIA AND PAKISTAN SETTLED THEIR DIFFERENCES, THERE WOULD BE LITTLE
HOPE OF DEFENDING THE SUBCONTINENT AGAINST CHINESE AGGRESSION .
HOTHEADED EXTREMISTS IN BOTH COUNTRIES OPPOSED THE IDEA OF TALKS .
KASHMIR IS NOT FOR SALE, SCREAMED AN INDIAN HEADLINE ; IN PAKISTAN'S
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, POLITICIANS ARGUED THAT COMMUNISM WAS FAR LESS AN
EVIL THAN " HINDU DOMINATION . " WHERE WAS THE ROOM FOR NEGOTIATION ?
OFFICIALLY PAKISTAN MAINTAINED THAT AN OVERALL PLEBISCITE IS THE ONLY
SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM . BUT PRIVATELY PAKISTAN HAS FALLBACK
POSITIONS, IS WILLING TO HOLD REGIONAL REFERENDUMS THAT WOULD GIVE
INDIA BOTH JAMMU AND LADAKH . THE REAL ISSUE, HOWEVER, WAS KASHMIR'S
VALE . PAKISTAN SEEMED AGREEABLE TO THE INTERNATIONALIZATION OF THE
IMPORTANT REGION . NEHRU, HOWEVER, FEARED THAT SECESSION OF ANY PART OF
KASHMIR WOULD ENCOURAGE SEPARATIST MOVEMENTS IN OTHER INDIAN STATES
WITH STRONG NATIONALIST TENDENCIES . NEVERTHELESS, INDIAN OFFICIALS
SHOWED UP IN RAWALPINDI FOR THE START OF NEGOTIATIONS LAST WEEK . THEY
WERE PREPARED FOR ALMOST ANY SURPRISE BUT THE ONE THAT ACTUALLY ARRIVED
. ON THE EVE OF THE CONFERENCE, PAKISTAN SUDDENLY ANNOUNCED AN
AGREEMENT " IN PRINCIPLE " WITH RED CHINA FOR A COMPLETE SETTLEMENT OF
THEIR MUTUAL BORDER DIFFERENCES . TO THE INDIANS IT WAS A STUNNING
BLOW, FOR IT SEEMED THAT THE PAKISTANIS WERE DELIBERATELY USING THE
CHINESE BOGEYMAN TO BLACKMAIL THEM INTO YIELDING BETTER TERMS ON THE
KASHMIR QUESTION . AFTER TWO DAYS OF NO PROGRESS, THE RAWALPINDI TALKS
WERE ADJOURNED FOR THREE WEEKS .

LAST WEEK . AT PEKING AIRPORT, PREMIER CHOU EN-LAI WELCOMED OUTER

AS A RUSSIAN PUPPET . WHISKED OFF IN A BLACK, SOVIET-MADE LIMOUSINE
AMONG CROWDS DUTIFULLY WAVING CHINESE AND MONGOLIAN FLAGS, TSEDENBAL

TREATY FIXING THE 2,500-MILE FRONTIER BETWEEN THEIR TWO COUNTRIES . IT
WAS ANOTHER LITTLE LESSON AIMED AT DELHI . AT THE FAREWELL BANQUET FOR
TSEDENBAL, PREMIER CHOU EN-LAI SMOOTHLY NOTED THAT RED CHINA HAD NOW
SOLVED ITS BORDER PROBLEMS ON THE BASIS OF " PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE "
